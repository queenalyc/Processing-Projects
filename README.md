Texture Effects:
Once the program is run, you will see that the object is black and there are 2 colour picker buttons
which control each effect; BlacknWhite, Emboss. First, please click on the image texture that you want
the effect to be on, next click on the effect button either BLACKNWHITE or EMBOSS. At this stage the object
will still be black, to see the effect, please click on the correct colour picker button according to the
effec that you have selected. 

For example, you would want to see the BlacknWhite effect, click on the BnW 
button first, next click on the colour picker button that is directly below the BnW button. 

The colour picker is according to RGBA. For the BlacknWhite effect, RGB controls the amount of blacks
and whites on the image and A which is alpha controls the transparency of the texture. 

Moving Textures:
For this question, the sequence to seeing the moving texture is the same as Question 3. Follow the steps to
getting the texture to map on the object and you will see the moving texture. 

Moving Displacement Effect:
Once the program is run, you will immediately see the moving displacement effect. The three buttons
correspond to the images, for changing the image, the steps are the same as Part A Question 2. 
The higher the subdivision, the obvious change in the vertices will be.
